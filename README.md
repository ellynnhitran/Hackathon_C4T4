## Overview

**Healthy Foodie website: Solve the problem of nutritional imbalance in Vietnam (by Macrobiotic Diet)**
* Please welcome to my website: 
[Healthy Foodie](https://healthy-foodie.herokuapp.com/)
* For this project, I learned and explored website programming, from HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap to how to crawl data, deploy apps in Heruko.

## File Structure

1. The root directory contains the following files:
   * ```app.py``` runs the app.
   * ```crawl.py``` scrapes website with Beautiful Soup.
   * ```food.py, mlab.py, populate.py``` uses Mlab and Mongoengines to export database.

2. The ```templates``` folder contains HTML templates and Javascript files to render.

3. The ```static``` folder contains static assets for the front-end: CSS style sheets, images, etc.
4. The ```models.py``` file connects to the database and contains Mongoengine.
